## Where to ask for help

## How to submit changes

Happy with your changes? Commit them! Once finished, create a pull request for other collaborators on the repo to review. Link the pull request to an existing issue if you were in the process of solving one on the list.

Once a pull request has been submitted, another collaborator on the repo will have to confirm it before merging it. Additional questions, clarifications, and adjustments may follow to help clarify if things aren't quite clear yet. 

- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

When your pull request has been approved, your contributions will be visible for all to see! Congrats! You've just brought us one step closer to making this repo something amazing.
